# Snipsonian

Typescript Snippets powered by Kunstmaan Development.
Besides typescript source code, also transpiled javascript files are published.
We'll add some documentation on how to use the different snippets in the future.


## Goal

* Provide some small re-usable typescript/javascript code snippets that can be used in a variety of javascript projects.
* Idea is that you just import (es6 syntax) the code snippet(s) you need and bundle it yourself with the rest of your project code (vs. having to include a 'large' concatenated/minified bundle of which you may only need a small part of)


## Usage

1. Add each snipsonian-package that you need by running `npm install --save @snipsonian/<packageName>`
    * e.g. `npm install --save @snipsonian/core` for the `core` package
2. Import the snippet you need by importing it's `/es/` version
    * e.g. `import isSet from '@snipsonian/core/es/is/isSet';`
    * each such `.js` snippet will have a related `.d.ts` file for the typescript types

## Development

### Installation

1. install nvm (https://github.com/creationix/nvm) if not installed yet
2. git clone <this repo>
3. switch to correct node version: `nvm install` (first time) or `nvm use` (later)
4. Link local packages together and install remaining package dependencies: `npx lerna bootstrap`


### Dev commands

#### `npm test`

Runs sequentially the linters and the unit tests.


### Publish new version

1. `nvm use`
2. execute `npm run to-es` to transpile the typescript code to .js and .d.ts files under the "/es", or "/cjs" for node packages, folders (per package)
3. manually briefly check the generated folders (snipsonian-analytics was previously generated somewhat wrong, but that issue is now fixed !)
4. switch to the appropriate npm user
5. execute one of:  (see https://github.com/lerna/lerna/tree/master/commands/publish)
    * `npx lerna publish` = publish packages that have changed since the last release
    * `npx lerna publish from-git` = explicitly publish packages tagged in the current commit
    * `npx lerna publish from-package` = explicitly publish packages where the latest version is not present in the registry
