# About

Snipsonian-scss is a collection of Sass utilities to ease and improve our implementations of common style-code patterns.

## Why?

### Avoid repetition
Snipsonian's primary goal is to save people like you and me from repeating the same few lines of styling code, over and over again, to achieve the same effect in different places.

### Do difficult hacky things easily
Like vertically centering, or creating fluid-width boxes with a consistent aspect ratio.
